Here are some Python problems involving string methods like slice, join, and split, along with their solutions:

Problem 1: Extract Substring Using Slice
Problem:
Given a string, extract the substring that starts from the 3rd character and ends at the 8th character (inclusive).

Example:
Input: "Hello, World!"
Output: "llo, W"

Solution:

python
Copy code
def extract_substring(s):
    return s[2:8]

# Test
print(extract_substring("Hello, World!"))  # Output: "llo, W"
Problem 2: Join a List of Words
Problem:
Given a list of words, join them into a single string separated by spaces.

Example:
Input: ["Python", "is", "fun"]
Output: "Python is fun"

Solution:

python
Copy code
def join_words(words):
    return " ".join(words)

# Test
print(join_words(["Python", "is", "fun"]))  # Output: "Python is fun"
Problem 3: Split a Sentence into Words
Problem:
Given a sentence, split it into a list of words.

Example:
Input: "Python is fun"
Output: ["Python", "is", "fun"]

Solution:

python
Copy code
def split_sentence(sentence):
    return sentence.split()

# Test
print(split_sentence("Python is fun"))  # Output: ["Python", "is", "fun"]
Problem 4: Reverse Words in a Sentence
Problem:
Given a sentence, reverse the order of words.

Example:
Input: "Hello World"
Output: "World Hello"

Solution:

python
Copy code
def reverse_words(sentence):
    words = sentence.split()
    reversed_words = words[::-1]
    return " ".join(reversed_words)

# Test
print(reverse_words("Hello World"))  # Output: "World Hello"
Problem 5: Extract Domain from Email
Problem:
Given an email address, extract the domain name.

Example:
Input: "user@example.com"
Output: "example.com"

Solution:

python
Copy code
def extract_domain(email):
    return email.split('@')[-1]

# Test
print(extract_domain("user@example.com"))  # Output: "example.com"
Problem 6: Replace Spaces with Hyphens
Problem:
Given a string, replace all spaces with hyphens.

Example:
Input: "Python is fun"
Output: "Python-is-fun"

Solution:

python
Copy code
def replace_spaces(s):
    return s.replace(" ", "-")

# Test
print(replace_spaces("Python is fun"))  # Output: "Python-is-fun"
Problem 7: Get First and Last Word
Problem:
Given a sentence, return a tuple containing the first and last words.

Example:
Input: "Learning Python is fun"
Output: ("Learning", "fun")

Solution:

python
Copy code
def first_and_last_word(sentence):
    words = sentence.split()
    return (words[0], words[-1])

# Test
print(first_and_last_word("Learning Python is fun"))  # Output: ("Learning", "fun")
Problem 8: Abbreviate a Name
Problem:
Given a full name, return the initials of the first name and the full last name.

Example:
Input: "John Doe"
Output: "J. Doe"

Solution:

python
Copy code
def abbreviate_name(full_name):
    parts = full_name.split()
    return f"{parts[0][0]}. {parts[1]}"

# Test
print(abbreviate_name("John Doe"))  # Output: "J. Doe"
These problems should help you practice and understand how to use string methods like slice, join, and split in Python.
